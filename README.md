# SysPort
Project carried out as part of my engineering training at ENSTA Bretagne.

I had to realize a program able to make facial recognition on streaming videos (in live) and to display the information stored in a database of identified persons. The goal was to write this information in a .json file to be able to use it via an Android mobile application (part realized by another member of my team).
